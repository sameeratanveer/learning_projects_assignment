This project aims to predict house rent prices using machine learning models. The dataset includes information about different houses, such as their location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and other features that influence rent pricing. The project explores multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to predict the rent prices accurately.
